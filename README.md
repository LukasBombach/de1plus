# de1plus

Node bindings for the Decent Espresso DE1 (+ / PRO / XL) machines.

Status: Initial project setup

Prerequisites:

You need to install TCL. On a mac homebrew will work:

```console
brew install tcl-tk
```

Currently there is just an index.js that runs tcl and I downloaded and cleaned up
the DE1's source code (i.e. I removed all the assets as we just need the TCL files).
